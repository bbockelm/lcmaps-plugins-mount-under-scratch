The "lcmaps-plugins-mount-under-scratch" plugin allows the admin to setup
per-invocation copies of world-writable directories such as /tmp or /var/tmp.

*If* $CWD is writable by the target/payload user and if the admin has
configured the plugin to mount /tmp and /var/tmp (the default) under scratch,
then open invocation, the following two directories will be created in $CWD:

tmp
var/tmp

Further, /tmp will map to $CWD/tmp and /var/tmp will map to $CWD/var/tmp for
the payload process (and *only* the payload process).

If /tmp or /var/tmp are on a shared-bind-mount (meaning the parent and child
namespace are identical for a subtree), the most specific subtree will be
remounted as private.

The above paragraphs are similar for admin-defined directories.

This plugin takes its inspiration from the implementation of the
MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH parameter in Condor, and is necessary for
MOUNT_UNDER_SCRATCH to work with glexec'd jobs.

If the $CWD directory is not writable, then this plugin does nothing and
returns a successful exit code.
